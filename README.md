RAML
====

RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) library for Haskell

TODO
----

Curently the `raml` library doesn't implement the full RAML specification. The
following features still need to be implemented:

 - [ ] Reading and verifying RAML header line `#%RAML 0.8`
 - [ ] `!include` links (markdown for docs, yaml anywhere)
 - [ ] Resource Types
 - [ ] Traits
 - [ ] Security
 - [ ] Top level schemas
